## Project 1: Basic analysis on order shipment (Python)

Overview: Some simple scripting and visualisation of dataset from coding test. Each line in the data set represents an order from a supermarket.

#### The graph represents the total number of customers and the number of times these customers have ordered from the super market on distinct order dates

#### The graph represents the profit over the sub categories of products found in the supermarket

#### The graph represents the sale by quantity of sub categories over duration of which the data is captured

## Project 2: Basic cleaning and visualisation (R)

Overview: Some simple scripting and visualisation of dataset from a school test. The dataset includes road accidents in the UK.

#### The graph represents the total number of accidents of different casualty types over duration of which the data is captured

#### The graph represents a density graph of total number of accidents across casualty types over the age of the casualty

#### The graph represents a spatial graph of accidents that have occurred using a heatmap
